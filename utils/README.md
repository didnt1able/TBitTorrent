# TBitTorrent

BitTorrent Client for terminal in Go. Written with [Gocui](https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui) and [rain](https://github.com/cenkalti/rain) library for my Final Year Project :D, Inspired by qbittorrent.

## Configuration


Most of the configurations are default from the rain torrent configurations, However you can change the configurations in the config.go file according to your liking. 


Note:
Thanks to [Gocui](https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui) and [rain](https://github.com/cenkalti/rain) for creating such amazing library so that i can create this :D. First time creating a Terminal ui app, its kinda messy so feel free to let me know what you guys think.
